# Mini Web Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of small web projects created to strengthen my front-end and overall web development skills.  
Each project focuses on a specific concept — from UI design and interactivity to logic and responsiveness.

## 💡 Purpose
To continuously build, learn, and showcase my development progress through small, meaningful projects.  
This repository serves as both a personal practice hub and a portfolio of my work that I can share on my resume.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository represents a separate mini project.  
Projects may vary in technology — from basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to frameworks and stacks like React or MERN.    
Projects are kept lightweight, easy to understand, and focused on one key concept at a time.

## 📬 Feedback
Suggestions, improvements, or ideas are always welcome!  
Feel free to open an issue or drop a comment if you’d like to collaborate or discuss any project.
